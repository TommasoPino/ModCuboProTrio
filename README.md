CubePro modification to use a generic filament

I think like a lot of person that an ABS filament that cost 150$/kg mustn't buy by anyone when the real price is 35$/kg. I modified my CubePro Trio to use a generic filament.

Notes: In this readme file you will find a sequence of instruction to riproduce my result. In the reposity there are a folder within some files that you need to reproduce with a 3D printer or as you want.
